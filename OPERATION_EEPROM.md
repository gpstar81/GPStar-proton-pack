# EEPROM Menus

There are two EEPROM menus available which can be accessed to adjust and save configurations onto either the Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand EEPROM memory. These are the **EEPROM LED Menu** and the **EEPROM Configuration Menu**.

‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTICE:** The EEPROM memory has a specified life of 100,000 write/erase cycles. You will generally not reach this limit in your lifetime, but if you did, it can be disabled to bypass it. Refer to the Advanced User Configurations below for more information.

## EEPROM LED Menu

The EEPOM LED Menu can be used to configure different LED setups for your Proton Pack. All changes can be saved directly to the Proton Pack EEPROM and will be loaded automatically even if you turn off the power to your devices.

To access the EEPROM LED Menu System, hold down the `Intensify Button` and toggle the right hand `Top Toggle` button 5 times (up and down). You will then hear a beep noise and your bargraph will light up to indicate you are in the EEPROM LED Menu System. The Neutrona Wand barrel and all the Proton Pack LEDs will light up to the default Spectral Custom colours when you enter the EEPROM LED Menu.

üìù **Note:** EEPROM menus can only be reached while both the Neutrona Wand and Proton Pack are powered down.

## EEPROM Configuration Menu

The EEPROM Configuration Menu can be used to save certain behaviours of your Neutrona Wand and Proton Pack as the standard settings.

To access the EEPROM Configuration Menu, hold down the `Intensify Button` and toggle the right hand `Bottom Toggle` button 5 times (up and down). You will then hear a beep noise and your bargraph will light up to indicate you are in the EEPROM Configuration Menu System.

To access the EEPROM Configuration menus, use the `Top Dial` on the top of the wand. When you reach the a new menu level, the Slo-blo LED and other lights on the Neutrona Wand will illuminate to indicate these menu levels, along with audio cues from the system.

	Menu Level 1 -> No additional wand lights will be illuminated
	Menu Level 2 -> Slo-Blo illuminated
	Menu Level 3 -> Slo-Blo and vent light illuminated
	Menu Level 4 -> Slo-Blo, vent light, and top gun box light illuminated
	Menu Level 5 -> Slo-Blo; vent light, top gun box light, and front gun box light illuminated

üìù **Note:** EEPROM menus can only be reached while both the Neutrona Wand and Proton Pack are powered down.

Please note whatever settings you have temporarily changed in the regular menus and sub menus will be applied automatically and saved if you exit the EEPROM menu by saving the settings.

| 2 | Overheat Lights | Enable/Disable the N-Filter LEDs from strobing during overheating. | Enable/Disable the Proton Pack lights to turn off during overheating. When disabled, after ramping down to a slower pace, the lights stay on.
| 1 | Default Year&nbsp;Mode / Overheat&nbsp;Sync&nbsp;to&nbsp;Fan | Set your default year mode between 1984/1989/Afterlife/Default. When set, the system will ignore the year mode toggle switch during bootup. However the toggle switch can still be used while the Proton Pack is on. If set to Default, the system picks the year mode based on the position of the year mode toggle switch in the Proton Pack. | Enable/Disable the overheat sync to fan. When enabled, the fan connections in the Proton Pack will only activate at the same time as the smoke connections. When disabled, the fan connections activate slightly after the smoke connections which allows some build of smoke before the fans activate. |

<sup>5</sup> Enables/disables the video game colour modes for the Proton Pack's Power Cell and Cyclotron lights. This only affects the pack when in Video Game mode, not for CTS modes, and offers the following states:

- Disable all the video game colours (Power Cell remains blue, Cyclotron remains red).
- Enable only the Power Cell LEDs to change colours (requires RGB Power Cell such as that offered by Frutto Technology).
- Enable only the Cyclotron LEDs to change colours (requires RGB replacement such as a Neopixel ring).
- Enable both the Power Cell and Cyclotron to use video game colours.
