# Single-Shot Blaster

### aka. Wrist Thrower, Compact Arm Thrower, Frozen Empire Arm Gauntlet

It may go by many names, though we know it as the arm-mounted Neutrona Wand as seen in Frozen Empire. For purposes of this guide we'll use the official name straight from the source when [Adam Savage met the propmaster for a look at the device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YypkmcPjQ8). This guide covers the use of components as typically used for a standard Neutrona Wand, repurposed to bring life to this device.

## External Shell - Completed or Models

There is no shortage of resources for the device shell itself, as it has been modeled and remixed by several members of the Ghostbusters community. Below are some of the found sources offering either the 3D files or pre-printed parts. If you know of another resource for either please let us know and we'll update this list.

## PCB Connection Details

Connections for the device should be made according to the tables below.

- Ordering aligns with PCB labels or when viewed left-to-right with the connector keyhole at the bottom right.
- Pins denoted A#/D# correspond to the internal code and connection to the controller chip.
- Ground may be designated as "GND" or simply "-".

### Socket Connections (JST-PH)

| Label | Pins | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| 5V-IN | +/\- | 2-pin JST-PH for power from internal battery<br/>**This MUST be a regulated 5V source!** |
| Q2 | VCC/D10/GND | 3-pin JST-PH connection for all addressable LEDs |
| SW45/SW4 | GND/D2/GND/D3 | 4-pin JST-PH connection for the Intensify button and Activate toggle |
| SW6 | GND/A6 | 2-pin JST-PH connection for the hand-grip mode/fire switch |

**Note:** The 3-pin connector for the LEDs will connect to a 7-LED NeoPixel Jewel and a GPStar Barrel Single-LED board.

### Wire Connectors (Terminal Blocks)

| Label/Pin | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| D8 | Slo-Blo VCC |
| GND | Slo-Blo GND |
| D4 | Lower-right Toggle (wire order does not matter) |
| GND | Lower-right Toggle (wire order does not matter) |
| A0 | Upper-right Toggle (wire order does not matter) |
| GND | Upper-right Toggle (wire order does not matter) |
| D9 | Clippard LED (Top Left) VCC |
| GND | Clippard LED (Top Left) GND |
| R+ | Rumble (vibration) motor VCC |
| R- | Rumble (vibration) motor GND |
| VCC | Power (+) for rotary encoder |
| D12 | Blinking top right LED |
| D13 | White vent light LED |
| VL+ | VCC for top/vent lights |
| D7 | Rotary encoder B (DT) |
| D6 | Rotary encoder A (CLK) |
| ROT- | Ground for rotary encoder |

### Special Connectors

| Label | Pins | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| HAT2 | GND/D23 | Connection for the wand box hat LED.<br><br>The left (top in the photo) pin is GND, the right (bottom in the photo) pin is D23 provides 5V and has a 150Î© resistor connected to it.<br><br>`Connector type: JST-PH`<br><br>`Do not draw more than 40mA from this connector.`|
| SCL/SDA | SCL/SDA | Reserved for the [28-segment bargraph](BARGRAPH.md) using I2C.<br><br>`Connector type: JST-PH`|
| 5V-OUT | +/\- | Power for the bargraph.<br><br>`Connector type: JST-PH` |
| AUDIO BOARD | GND/NC/VCC/TX/RX/NC | Communication and Power for the wands's GPStar Audio or WAV Trigger.<br><br>`Connector type: JST-PH` |
| ICSP | DO NOT USE! | Programming header for bootloader updates (reserved).<br><br>`Connector type: Header pins` |
| UART | See Below | Programming header for software updates (optional).<br><br>`Connector type: Header pins` |

For connecting the UART pins, use a suitable FTDI chip such as the same **FTDI Basic 5V** used for programming the GPStar Audio or WAV Trigger. Pins on the PCB should align with with the standard wire order for FTDI-to-USB cables which use a single Dupont 6-pin connector. Observe these common colors and notes to ensure proper orientation:

- The ground pin will typically be a black wire, while VCC will typically be red.
- The DTR pin on the PCB will connect to a wire labelled either DTR or RTS.
- Any wire labelled CTS will be connected to the 2nd pin labelled GND on the PCB.
- Be careful to not reverse the connector!
