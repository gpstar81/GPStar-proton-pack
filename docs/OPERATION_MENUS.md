When you are in the settings menu system the bargraph's 5 LEDs begin flashing (or 5 distinct segments when using the 28-segment or 30-segment bargraph). All other functions of the wand (such as firing) are temporarily disabled while in the menu system. There are 5 different menu settings, which are indicated by bargraph LED segments 1 through 5 (from bottom to top) with menu level 5 being the default upon entering this mode. For example in navigation, when 1 LED (or bargraph segment) is flashing/displayed that means you are on `Option 1`.
