<center>For the Proton Pack, Neutrona Wand, and Accessories</center>

## Summary

A fully integrated Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand, packed with features and add-ons. Compatible with the HasLab Plasma Series Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand, Mack's Proton Pack and Wand, and more!

- Polyphonic sound
  - Allows simultaneous playback of multiple audio tracks which can be layered together to create a rich experience with smoothly layered sound effects and buttery smooth transitions.
  - While blasting away with the Proton stream you can still hear all the layers of sound effects that came before...the Pack effects, each Wand toggle effect, Music etc.
- Wand / Pack communication system
   - By implementing both the pack and wand controllers with an upgraded hose connection, both devices work seamlessly together. Interactions with the wand have an immediate effect on the pack, and vice-versa.
   - This functionality includes sound effects, alarm triggers, Cyclotron interaction, venting/overheat sequences, and proton stream effects (eg. video game colours and crossing the streams).

### Walkthrough Videos

*"You know, it just occurred to me that we really haven't had a successful test of this equipment." -Ray Stantz*

Except that we have! Here is a [Walkthrough Video Contributed by JustinDustin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnfljGd5-uU) (YouTube, March 2023) showcasing several of the stock features in a converted pack/wand combination. Several optional features were implemented as part of this build using the Arduino platform.

### Guides Everywhere!

*"Ray, pretend for a moment that I don't know anything about metallurgy, engineering, or physics, and just tell me what the hell is going on." -Dr. Venkman*

That's alright, this will help you study. Start with [the Component Guides section](GUIDE_LISTING.md) to find the dedicated guides to build out your new electronic brains, and maybe find some cool new features to implement as part of the addendums.

### About our Effects files

The sound effects files furnished with this project are combination of self made files to those contributed within the Ghostbusters community, etc. We do apologize if it is forgotten to acknowledge where some of the files originate from, though we do our best to share credit where due. See the [About](ABOUT.md) page for more information.

### "Yes, have some"...music!

Special thanks to Michael Klodzinksi for graciously allowing us to include his version of [Savin' The Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shJslMSAxE0) as a bundled music file to demo your awesome Proton Pack mods! Check out his other works at [michaelk.net](https://michaelk.net).
