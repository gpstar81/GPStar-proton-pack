# EEPROM Menus

There are two EEPROM menus available which can be accessed to adjust and save configurations onto either the Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand EEPROM memory. These are the **EEPROM LED Menu** and the **EEPROM Configuration Menu**.

‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTICE:** The EEPROM memory has a specified life of 100,000 write/erase cycles. You will generally not reach this limit in your lifetime, but if you did, it can be disabled to bypass it. Refer to the Advanced User Configurations below for more information.

## LEDs - Top Menu

The EEPOM LED Menu can be used to configure different LED setups for your Proton Pack. All changes can be saved directly to the Proton Pack EEPROM and will be loaded automatically even if you turn off the power to your devices.

To access the EEPROM LED Menu System, hold down the `Intensify Button` and toggle the right hand `Top Toggle` button 5 times (up and down). You will then hear a beep noise and your bargraph will light up to indicate you are in the EEPROM LED Menu System. The Neutrona Wand barrel and all the Proton Pack LEDs will light up to the default Spectral Custom colours when you enter the EEPROM LED Menu. Use the `Top Dial` on the top of the Neutrona Wand to navigate the menu system and options. When you reach a different menu level, the Slo-Blo LED and other lights on the Neutrona Wand will illuminate to indicate these menu levels, along with audio cues from the system.

	Menu Level 1 -> No additional wand lights will be illuminated
	Menu Level 2 -> Slo-Blo illuminated

üìù **Note:** EEPROM menus can only be reached while both the Neutrona Wand and Proton Pack are powered down.

## Configuration - Bottom Menu

The EEPROM Configuration Menu can be used to save certain behaviours of your Neutrona Wand and Proton Pack as the standard settings.

To access the EEPROM Configuration Menu, hold down the `Intensify Button` and toggle the right hand `Bottom Toggle` button 5 times (up and down). You will then hear a beep noise and your bargraph will light up to indicate you are in the EEPROM Configuration Menu System.

To access the EEPROM Configuration menus, use the `Top Dial` on the top of the wand. When you reach a different menu level, the Slo-Blo LED and other lights on the Neutrona Wand will illuminate to indicate these menu levels, along with audio cues from the system.

	Menu Level 1 -> No additional wand lights will be illuminated
	Menu Level 2 -> Slo-Blo illuminated
	Menu Level 3 -> Slo-Blo and vent light illuminated
	Menu Level 4 -> Slo-Blo, vent light, and top gun box light illuminated
	Menu Level 5 -> Slo-Blo; vent light, top gun box light, and front gun box light illuminated

üìù **Note:** EEPROM menus can only be reached while both the Neutrona Wand and Proton Pack are powered down.

Please note whatever settings you have temporarily changed in the regular menus and sub menus will be applied automatically and saved if you exit the EEPROM menu by saving the settings.

### Configuration Menu - Level 1

| Option | Purpose | Intensify&nbsp;Button | Barrel&nbsp;Wing&nbsp;Button |
|:------:|---------|------------------|--------------------|
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ | Save or Clear the EEPROM settings | Clear all the configuration only settings in the Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand EEPROMs.<br/><br/>**The Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand will instead load the software defined defaults the next time you power-cycle from the battery.** | Save the current settings to the Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand EEPROMs.<br/><br/>**It is advised to power-cycle your equipment after saving settings to ensure the proper defaults/values are loaded, such as the case of changing the System Mode.** |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | Firing&nbsp;Mode&nbsp;Selection&nbsp;/ Spectral&nbsp;Modes | Cycle through VG/CTS operation modes to set as your default.<sup>1</sup> | Enable/Disable the Spectral Modes. |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | Overheating&nbsp;/ Smoke | Enable/Disable Overheating Ability | Enable/Disable Smoke Effects |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | Cyclotron&nbsp;LED&nbsp;Control | Cyclotron rotation direction. Clockwise or counter clockwise. | Enable/Disable the Cyclotron Lid Ring Simulation in Afterlife and Frozen Empire mode.<br/>ONLY applies to use of the 12, 20, or 36 LED hardware options. |

Note that Video Game mode is only available in Super Hero mode.

### Configuration Menu - Level 2

| Option | Purpose | Intensify Button | Barrel Wing Button |
|:------:|---------|------------------|--------------------|
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ | Quick&nbsp;Vent&nbsp;/ Wand&nbsp;Boot&nbsp;Errors | Enable/Disable the Quick Venting feature. When enabled, you can manually vent your Proton Pack by pressing the Intensify button while the top right toggle switch is switched down. <br><br>üìù `Super Hero mode only` | Enable to disable the Wand boot error mode. When enabled, if you turn on the Neutrona Wand while the top right toggle is up and activated, the Neutrona Wand enters an error mode and remains locked out until the switches are all turned off. <br><br>üìù `Super Hero mode only` |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | Vibration&nbsp;Settings | Cycle through Proton Pack vibration options<sup>2</sup> | Cycle through Neutrona Wand vibration options |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | Wand&nbsp;Beep&nbsp;Loop&nbsp;/ VGA&nbsp;Colour&nbsp;Mode&nbsp;Toggles | Enable/Disable the looping beep sound effect in Afterlife and Frozen Empire Mode. | Cycle through VG colour modes.<sup>3</sup> |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | Overheat&nbsp;Lights | Enable/Disable the N-Filter LEDs from strobing during overheating. | Enable/Disable the Proton Pack lights to turn off during overheating. When disabled, after ramping down to a slower pace, the lights stay on.
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | Default Year&nbsp;Mode&nbsp;/ Overheat&nbsp;Sync&nbsp;to&nbsp;Fan | Set your default year mode between 1984/1989/Afterlife/Frozen Empire/Default. When set, the system will ignore the year mode toggle switch during bootup. However the toggle switch can still be used while the Proton Pack is on. If set to Default, the system picks the year mode based on the position of the year mode toggle switch in the Proton Pack.<sup>4</sup> | Enable/Disable the overheat sync to fan. When enabled, the fan connections in the Proton Pack will only activate at the same time as the smoke connections. When disabled, the fan connections activate slightly after the smoke connections which allows some build of smoke before the fans activate. |

<sup>2</sup> See [Inner Cyclotron](CYCLOTRON_INNER.md) for more information on the motorised cyclotron modification for the Proton Pack.

<sup>3</sup> Enables/disables the video game colour modes for the Proton Pack's Power Cell and Cyclotron lights. This only affects the pack when in Video Game mode, not for CTS modes, and offers the following states:

- Disable all the video game colours (Power Cell remains blue, Cyclotron remains red).
- Enable only the Power Cell LEDs to change colours (requires RGB Power Cell).
- Enable only the Cyclotron LEDs to change colours (requires RGB replacement such as a Neopixel ring).
- Enable both the Power Cell and Cyclotron to use video game colours.

<sup>4</sup> If the Neutrona Wand is in standalone mode, this does nothing. To change the default year for a standalone Neutrona Wand, please see Menu Level 3 below.

| Option | Purpose | Intensify Button | Barrel Wing Button |
|:------:|---------|------------------|--------------------|
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ | System&nbsp;Default&nbsp;Volume&nbsp;/ Neutrona&nbsp;Wand&nbsp;Year&nbsp;Mode | `(Intensify + Top Dial)` Adjusts the default volume for the system.

### Configuration Menu - Level 5

Toggles overheating ability and continuous smoke effects during firing for each wand power level. The continuous smoke effects will randomly activate for very short bursts while continuously firing for long periods.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

**Running your smoke devices for long periods can potentially damage them, and/or reduce battery life. Adjust these settings with caution and use at your own risk!**
