# Advanced Configuration

The following guide explores the variables and constants which are user-changeable within the code. The purpose of these changes is to set preferred defaults for the operation of your Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand at bootup, meaning just after the devices have battery power applied. These defaults will avoid the need to switch operation modes and other settings through the menu system.

Please consider all items as changeable at your own risk. Deviating from any recommended values may impact the operation of your pack and wand and cause unwanted or odd behavior. Bug reports or issues which arise from modification of these values will be considered moot unless accompanied by copies of changed files to aid in reproducing the behavior.

All user-configurable values reside within their respective `Configuration.h` file. Note that when loading the .ino file to the Arduino IDE this should load the related .h files automatically.

For more information on how to compile and flash a custom binary after modifying `Configuration.h`, please see [COMPILING_FLASHING.md](COMPILING_FLASHING.md) for GPStar hardware or [DIY_FLASHING.md](DIY_FLASHING.md) for DIY Arduino builds.

## EEPROM Data

For those who customise their settings and flash their boards manually, any saved settings in the Proton Pack or Neutrona Wand EEPROM can override some settings that you manually flash to your Proton Pack or Neutrona Wand's main system memory. Examples include the Cyclotron and Power Cell Delays, the number of LEDs defined for the Power Cell or Cyclotron, overheating options, etc. You can either override the EEPROM settings by setting `b_eeprom = false` in the Proton Pack and or Neutrona Wand Configuration.h file before flashing or clearing all the saved settings in your EEPROM from the EEPROM LED Menu System and EEPROM Configuration Menu System.

Refer to the [Operation Manual](OPERATION_USAGE.md) for more information on how to enter the different EEPROM menu systems.

`EEPROM data saving and menu system is only available while using the GPStar Neutrona Wand board with your Neutrona Wand, or via the web interface when using an ESP32 wireless module or Attenuator.`

***The EEPROM memory has a specified life of 100,000 write/erase cycles. You will generally not reach this limit in your lifetime, but if you did or wish to disable the EEPROM loading system, refer to*** `const bool b_eeprom` ***in the Proton Pack table below.***

| bool b&#95;fade&#95;cyclotron&#95;led | When set to false, the LEDs on the Cyclotron Lid in 1984/1989 mode will not fade between lens transitions which is closer to their appearance in the films. Set to true to get an appearance closer to the 2009 video game. <br><br>`This can be toggled from the Neutrona Wand sub menu system.` | true |
| bool b&#95;cyclotron&#95;single&#95;led | When set to true, the LEDs on the Cyclotron Lid will light up the middle LED only per Cyclotron lens in 1984 and 1989 mode.

This can be toggled in the Neutrona Wand sub menu system.` | true |
| const bool b&#95;cyclotron&#95;haslab&#95;chsv&#95;colour&#95;change | When using 12 LEDs for the Cyclotron Lid (Stock HasLab), the system will default it to always red because changing the colour space with a CHSV colour object affects the brightness slightly for non RGB pixels such as the ones used in the HasLab Cyclotron Lid. If you are using 12 LEDs that are RGB, they will always be red when this is set to false. Setting this to true will override it and make the LEDs change colour if they are RGB.<br><br>`This only affects when you are using 12 LEDs for the Cyclotron Lid (HasLab)` | false |
| uint8&#95;t i&#95;powercell&#95;leds | Power Cell LED count. There are 13 LEDs in the stock HasLab Power Cell.

The default setting is true, which makes the Power Cell change colours to match the Video Game Modes.<br><br>`This has no affect on the stock HasLab Power Cell LEDs, which are blue only. This can be toggled in the Neutrona Wand sub menu system.` | true |
| uint8&#95;t i&#95;inner&#95;cyclotron&#95;cake&#95;num&#95;leds | This setting controls how many optional LEDs are in the Inner (cake) Cyclotron. Default setting of 35 is for a 35 pixel NeoPixel ring. If you change this for a smaller NeoPixel ring, you may need to alter the i&#95;2021&#95;inner&#95;delay and i&#95;1984&#95;inner&#95;delay to lower values to slow down the rotation speed for a smaller ring. | 35 |
| LED&#95;TYPES CAVITY&#95;LED&#95;TYPE | Sets the default LED type for the inner cyclotron cavity fairy lights. Choices are `RGB_LED`, `GRB_LED` or `GBR_LED`. | `RGB_LED` |
