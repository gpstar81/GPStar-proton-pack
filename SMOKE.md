# Smoke Effects

Below are some examples of how to implement smoke into your Proton Pack. There are 4 outputs on the DIY Arduino Mega and gpstar Proton Pack PCB that are configured to go 5V HIGH during smoke effect phases:

- Smoke1 `SM-1 - gpstar Proton Pack PCB` or `Pin 39 - Arudino Mega` aka. N-Filter Smoke
- Smoke2 `SM-2 - gpstar Proton Pack PCB` or `Pin 35 - Arduino Mega` aka. Booster Smoke
- Fan1 `FN-1 - gpstar Proton Pack PCB` or `Pin 33 - Arduino Mega` aka. N-Filter Fan
- Fan2 `FN-2 - gpstar Proton Pack PCB` or `Pin 50 - Arduino Mega` aka. Booster Fan

**Note: Fan1 is set to go off during overheat sequence only. It is useful for pushing smoke through the N-Filter**

**Note: Fan2 is set to go off at the same time as Smoke2. This was requested if you want to repurpose Smoke2 from the booster tube for another purpose. For the purpose of smoke in the booster tube, this is not required.**

Each pin is designed to make use of a transistor to activate pumps, external devices, etc.

**WARNINGS**

- For `gpstar Proton Pack PCB boards`, the `SM-1, SM-2, FN-1 and FN-2` connectors provide 5V of power and can power devices such as pumps and fans. However do not connect any device which draws more than 1 Amp of current. Use a relay module (such as [this](https://a.co/d/4BXJ9J1) or [this](https://a.co/d/iEuGPYK)) to drive such devices.
	- For devices which require a dedicated power source (such as 12V) ALWAYS use a relay module.
- For DIY Arduino Users: `DO NOT DRAW MORE THAN 40mA FROM AN ARDUINO MEGA PIN`. Use a transistor setup or relay module as previously noted.

## Schematic Examples

The following diagrams demonstrate the connections required for several smoke devices. These have been either directly verified or confirmed as "expected" by their respective makers. Other kits may be used, provided they adhere to the use of a relay for applying power directly to a vape coil device.

## Booster Tube Example

*Provided by gpstar*

For this example, I used the following parts:

- 1 - [Air Pump and Vacuum DC Motor 4.5V](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4699) 
- 1 - [Vape Pen](https://www.joyetech.com/product/eroll-mac/)
- [Silicone Tubing for Air Pumps](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4661)
- 1 - [1n4001 Diode](https://www.adafruit.com/product/755)
- 1 - 330 ohm Resistor -> Refer to [Bill of Materials](BOM.md)
- 1 - PN2222 NPN Transitor -> Refer to [Bill of Materials](BOM.md)
- 100% Pure Vegetable Glycerine for the vape pen to generate smoke

This will be using SMOKE2, which is Pin #35 on the Arduino Mega or the SM-2 connector on the gpstar Proton Pack PCB. In the pack schematic diagrams if you are using an Arduino Mega, refer to SMOKE2 setup on the breadboard for the connection guide in the PACK instructions for more detail instructions. A quick rundown on what happens is, Pin #35 on the Arduino Mega or the SM-2 connector on the gpstar Proton Pack PCB goes high during smoke events, which makes the transistor open and the connected DC pump will then have 5V power which begins to operate. I removed the original battery compartment in the HasLab motherboard, so I have quick access to the vape pen from the battery door on the motherboard when it needs recharging and refilling with more vegetable glycerine.

Here are some photos the basic smoke setup.

## N-Filter Example

This also uses a vape pen approach with a 3V mini aquarium pump, and can be run from a 3V relay module. The vape pen (T2 Clearomizer style) uses a 1.8 ohm coil and wants about 3.6-4V to make decent smoke. Meanwhile, the pump doesn't like much above 3V and above 4V is pushing it. Since both run for short bursts you can split the difference and use 3.8V which is about right for decent smoke AND to push everything out of the cartridge, and so far only the coil gets the hottest of all the components.

For basic instructions on creating the smoke machine itself, you may follow [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDISX8MMLak) which essentially pairs the clearomizer tank with the air pump and provides the wiring for that module. You can successfully run both devices off of a single pair of shared positive and negative wires.

For the 5V relay, this was paired with a dedicated DC buck converter taking 12V from a Talentcell battery down to 3.8V. A toggle switch (optional) was used completely cut the power to the converter and anything downstream from it. The relay module needs 5V and requires 60mA to activate, and so this can be safely used with the provided smoke pins noted above.

To activate and trigger with only the 2 wires provided by the SMOKE1 pin #39 on the Arduino Mega or SM-1 connector on the gpstar Proton Pack PCB, connect the positive (+) from the smoke pin to both the DC+ and IN terminals of the relay module (a small length of wire can be used as a jumper). Connect the negative (\-) to the DC- terminal. The purpose of this relay is to electrically isolate the power source for the vape coil and air pump, which may require 1 Amp of current (or more) and a voltage which differs from the 5V used by the controller. This allows you to also use a completely separate battery for smoke if you wish, as there is no need for a common ground or other connection to the microcontroller.

![](images/RelayTrigger.jpg)

The vape coil and air pump should have their positive leads connected together, and the negative leads connected together. The positive OUT terminal of the DC buck converter is connected to the NO (normally-open) terminal on the relay module while the combined positive leads are connected to the COM (common) terminal. The negative leads should connect directly to the DC buck converter's negative OUT terminal.

To deliver smoke to the N-Filter, air line tubing is used with a quick-connect attached to the end of the vape tank and fed to the center of the cone under the filter. The middle of the cone is drilled out to allow the tubing to come up from below--which means drilling a hole into the base under the cone for the tubing plus a small hole for the blower fan. The blower fan is then simply placed vertically under the base of the cone and will help push any smoke out the top of the N-Filter. I used some scrap EVA foam and hot glue to keep the fan in place, oriented vertically under the N-Filter.

![](images/NFilterFan.jpg)

One issue encountered is that within the N-Filter portion of the Cyclotron Lid is a screw post which sits directly over the cone and will block smoke flow. Using a small drill bit, it is possible to slowly drill out 2-3 holes within the plastic screw post which will let smoke enter the top of the N-Filter, and will be vented by the blower fan via the screened holes. The preview below shows how effective the fan can be at pushing the smoke generated.
