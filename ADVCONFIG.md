# Advanced Configuration

The following guide explores the variables and constants which are user-changeable within the code. The purpose of these changes is to set preferred defaults for the operation of your Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand at bootup, meaning just after the devices have battery power applied. These defaults will avoid the need to switch operation modes and other settings through the menu system.

Please consider all items as changeable at your own risk. Deviating from any recommended values may impact the operation of your pack and wand and cause unwanted or odd behavior. Bug reports or issues which arise from modification of these values will be considered moot unless accompanied by copies of changed files to aid in reproducing the behavior.

All user-configurable values reside within their respective `Configuration.h` file. Note that when loading the .ino file to the Arduino IDE this should load the related .h files automatically.

## EEPROM Data

For those who customise their settings and flash their boards manually, any saved settings in the Proton Pack or Neutrona Wand EEPROM can override some settings that you manually flash to your Proton Pack or Neutrona Wand's main system memory. Examples include the Cyclotron and Power Cell Delays, the number of LEDs defined for the Power Cell or Cyclotron, overheating options, etc. You can either override the EEPROM settings by setting `b_eeprom = false` in the Proton Pack and or Neutrona Wand Configuration.h file before flashing or clearing all the saved settings in your EEPROM from the EEPROM LED Menu System and EEPROM Configuration Menu System.

Refer to the [Operation Manual](OPERATION.md) for more information on how to enter the different EEPROM menu systems.

`EEPROM data saving and menu system is only available while using the GPStar Neutrona Wand board with your Neutrona Wand.`

***The EEPROM memory has a specified life of 100,000 write/erase cycles. You will generally not reach this limit in your lifetime, but if you did or wish to disable the EEPROM loading system, refer to*** `const bool b_eeprom` ***in the Proton Pack table below.***

## Proton Pack

|Variable| Description| Default Setting |

| uint8&#95;t i&#95;cyclotron&#95;leds | Cyclotron Lid LED count. There are 12 LEDs in the stock HasLab Cyclotron Lid. If you install a 40 LED NeoPixel ring in your Cyclotron Lid, then this should be set to 40.

They will change colour accordingly if you switch to video game modes firing modes.`| 12 |

If you install a Frutto Technology Power Cell which has 15 LEDs, then change this to 15. You can also add your own addressable LEDs, adjust the count as necessary.<br><br>`If you add more Power Cell LEDs, you may want to adjust the i_powercell_delay_2021 and i_powercell_delay_1984 to lower numbers to speed up the Power Cell delay to reflect the additional LEDs. For 15 LEDs, 1984 at 60 and 2021 at 34 are good settings.`| 13 |
| bool b&#95;cyclotron&#95;colour&#95;toggle | If you are using Cyclotron Lid LEDs and Inner Cyclotron LEDs with RGB support, such as the Frutto Technology Cyclotron LEDs or NeoPixel Rings etc. You can toggle if you want it to change colours to match the Video Game Modes or stay the default Red at all times.

This can be toggled in the Neutrona Wand sub menu system.`| true |
| bool b&#95;powercell&#95;colour&#95;toggle | If you are using Power Cell LEDs with RGB support, such as the Frutto Technology Power Cells, you can toggle if you want it to change colours to match the Video Game Modes or stay the default Blue at all times.

This can be toggled in the Neutrona Wand sub menu system.`| true |
| const int i&#95;1984&#95;delay | This controls the delay in milliseconds when a LED changes on the Cyclotron Lid in 1984 mode. The default setting is 1050 which is 1.05 seconds. | 1050 |

| uint8&#95;t i&#95;inner&#95;cyclotron&#95;num&#95;leds | This setting controls how many optional LEDs are in the Inner (cake) Cyclotron. Default setting of 35 is for a 35 pixel NeoPixel ring. If you change this for a smaller NeoPixel ring, you may need to alter the i&#95;2021&#95;inner&#95;delay and i&#95;1984&#95;inner&#95;delay to lower values to slow down the rotation speed for a smaller ring. | 35 |

| bool b&#95;mode&#95;original&#95;toggle&#95;sounds&#95;enabled | When set to true, the Neutrona Wand plays sound effects with the toggle switches only in MODE_ORIGINAL. This does not affect MODE_SUPER_HERO mode.  | true |
| bool b&#95;beep&#95;loop | When set to false, the Neutrona Wand will no longer loop the beep sound effect in Afterlife mode. | true |
| bool b&#95;overheat&#95;mode&#95;1 | Set to true if you want the Neutrona Wand and Proton Pack to overheat in **wand power mode 1** | false |

| const bool b&#95;eeprom | Set to true if you want to read the configuration data from the EEPROM memory in the Neutrona Wand.<br><br>`The EEPROM memory has a specified life of 100,000 write/erase cycles. You will generally not reach this limit in your lifetime, but if you did, it can be disabled to bypass it.` | true |
| const bool b&#95;amplify&#95;wand&#95;speaker | Set to true to add extra amplification to the Neutrona Wand speaker. When using the Hasbro 16ohm 0.25watt speaker with GPStar Audio you want to set this to false so you do not overpower the speaker. When using a 4ohm 2.5W or 8ohm 1.25W speaker or equivalent you can set this to true to have louder audio from the Neutrona Wand speaker. | false |
| const bool b&#95;gpstar&#95;benchtest | Set this to true if you want to use your Neutrona Wand without a Proton Pack connected. Otherwise when false, the Neutrona Wand will wait until it is connected to a Proton Pack before it can activate. | false |
