# Advanced Configuration					
The following guide explores the variables and constants which are user-changeable within the code. The purpose of these changes is to set preferred defaults for the operation of your Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand at bootup, meaning just after the devices have battery power applied. These defaults will avoid the need to switch operation modes and other settings through the menu system.

Please consider all items as changeable at your own risk. Deviating from any recommended values may impact the operation of your pack and wand and cause unwanted or odd behavior. Bug reports or issues which arise from modification of these values will be considered moot unless accompanied by copies of changed files to aid in reproducing the behavior.

All user-configurable values reside within their respective `Configuration.h` file. Note that when loading the .ino file to the Arduino IDE this should load the related .h files automatically.

## EEPROM Data
For those who customise your settings and flash your boards manually, any saved settings in the Proton Pack or Neutrona Wand EEPROM can override some settings that you manually flash to your Proton Pack or Neutrona Wand's main system memory. Such as the Cyclotron and Power Cell Delays, the number of leds defined for the Power Cell or Cyclotron's, Overheating options, etc. You can either override the EEPROM settings by setting `b_eeprom = false` in the Proton Pack and or Neutrona Wand Configuration.h file before flashing or clearing all the saved settings in your EEPROM from the EEPROM LED Menu System and EEPROM Configuration Menu System.

Refer to the [Operation Manual](OPERATION.md) for more information on how to enter the different EEPROM menu systems.

`EEPROM data saving and menu system is only available while using the gpstar Neutrona Wand board with your Neutrona Wand.`

***The EEPROM memory has a specified life of 100,000 write/erase cycles. You will generally not reach this limit in your lifetime, but if you did or wish to disable the EEPROM loading system, refer to*** `const bool b_eeprom` ***in the Proton Pack table below.***

## Proton Pack

|Variable| Description| Default Setting |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| uint8&#95;t i&#95;cyclotron&#95;leds | Cyclotron lid LED count. There are 12 LEDs in the stock Haslab Cyclotron lid. If you install a 40 LED NeoPixel ring in your Cyclotron lid, then this should be set to 40. The default setting is 12. <br><br>`The cyclotron lid can support up to 40 (rgbw) addressable LEDs such as NeoPixels (ws2812b). They will change colour accordingly if you switch to video game modes firing modes.`| 12 |
| int i&#95;1984&#95;cyclotron&#95;leds[4] | This is the middle led aligned in each cyclotron lens. Put the sequence in order from lowest to highest in a clockwise direction. The top right lens is the cyclotron lens #1 and work your way clockwise. The default setting is { 1, 4, 7, 10 } which is for the stock Haslab LEDs. If you installed a 40 LED NeoPixel ring in your cyclotron lid, then the settings of { 0, 10, 18, 28 } is recommended depending on how you aligned the ring. | { 1, 4, 7, 10 } |
| uint8&#95;t i&#95;powercell&#95;leds | Powercell LED count. There are 13 LEDs in the stock Haslab Power Cell. If you install a Frutto Technology Power Cell which has 15 LEDs, then change this to 15. You can also add your own addressable LEDs, adjust the count as necessary.<br><br>`If you add more Power Cell LEDs, you may want to adjust the i_powercell_delay_2021 and i_powercell_delay_1984 to lower numbers to speed up the Power Cell delay to reflect the additional LEDs. For 15 LEDs, 1984 at 60 and 2021 at 34 are good settings.`| 13 |
| bool b&#95;cyclotron&#95;colour&#95;toggle | If you are using Cyclotron Lid LEDs and Inner Cyclotron LEDs with RGB support, such as the Frutto Technology Cyclotron LEDs or NeoPixel Rings etc. You can toggle if you want it to change colours to match the Video Game Modes or stay the default Red at all times. The default setting is true, which makes the Cyclotron Lid and Inner Cyclotron change colours to match the Video Game Modes.<br><br>`This has no affect on the stock Haslab Cyclotron Lid LEDs, which are red only. This can be toggled in the Neutrona wand sub menu system.`| true |
| bool b&#95;powercell&#95;colour&#95;toggle | If you are using Power Cell LEDs with RGB support, such as the Frutto Technology Power Cells, you can toggle if you want it to change colours to match the Video Game Modes or stay the default Blue at all times. The default setting is true, which makes the Power Cell change colours to match the Video Game Modes.<br><br>`This has no affect on the stock Haslab Power Cell LEDs, which are blue only. This can be toggled in the Neutrona wand sub menu system.`| true |
| const int i&#95;1984&#95;delay | This controls the delay in milliseconds when a LED changes on the cyclotron lid in 1984 mode. The default setting is 1050 which is 1.05 seconds. | 1050 |

| uint8&#95;t i&#95;powercell&#95;delay&#95;1984 | This controls the delay in milliseconds when a LED changes in the power cell in 1984/1989 mode. The default setting is 75 which is for 13 LEDs in the stock Haslab Power Cell. If you replace the Power Cell with more LEDs, it is suggested to lower this number to get a proper speed. | 75 |
| uint8&#95;t i&#95;inner&#95;cyclotron&#95;num&#95;leds | This setting controls how many optional LEDs are in the Inner (cake) Cyclotron. Default setting of 35 is for a 35 pixel NeoPixel ring. If you change this for a smaller NeoPixel ring, you may need to alter the i&#95;2021&#95;inner&#95;delay and i&#95;1984&#95;inner&#95;delay to lower values to slow down the rotation speed for a smaller ring. | 35 |
| bool b&#95;grb&#95;cyclotron | If you use GRB (green/red/blue) instead of RGB (red/green/blue) addressable LEDs for your Inner Cyclotron, then set to true. | false |

| const bool b&#95;debug | Debug testing. Set to true to debug the A6 and A7 analog pin readings of the Neutrona Wand. This uses the USB port and the tx/rx pins need to be disconnected from the Proton Pack so serial information can be sent back to the Arduino IDE.<br><br>`The Neutrona Wand will respond slower in this mode as it is streaming constant serial data back to the debugger.` | false |
| const bool b&#95;eeprom | Set to true if you want to read the configuration data from the EEPROM memory in the Neutrona Wand.<br><br>`The EEPROM memory has a specified life of 100,000 write/erase cycles. You will generally not reach this limit in your lifetime, but if you did, it can be disabled to bypass it.` | true |
