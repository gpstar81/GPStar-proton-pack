## Summary

A fully integrated Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand, packed with features and add-ons. Compatible with the HasLab Plasma Series Proton Pack and Neutrona Wand, Mack's Proton Pack and Wand, and more!

- Polyphonic sound
  - Allows simultaneous playback of multiple audio tracks which can be layered together to create a rich experience with smoothly layered sound effects and buttery smooth transitions.
  - While blasting away with the Proton stream you can still hear all the layers of sound effects that came before...the Pack effects, each Wand toggle effect, Music etc.
- Wand / Pack communication system
   - By implementing both the pack and wand controllers with an upgraded hose connection, both devices work seamlessly together. Interactions with the wand have an immediate effect on the pack, and vice-versa.
   - This functionality includes sound effects, alarm triggers, Cyclotron interaction, venting/overheat sequences, and proton stream effects (eg. video game colours and crossing the streams).
