# Neutrona Wand Setup

**As of November 2023 the last release to support software builds for the Arduino Nano was v2.2.0. Due to memory limitations of this device no further software updates are possible. This guide exists solely for educational/legacy purposes only and is considered deprecated.**

This guide begins with some explanations for common items you will encounter during the upgrade process. Note that it will be necessary to upgrade the hose and conductors between the pack and wand. This exercise is left to individual preferences on connectors and style of replacement, though you will need 4 conductors at a minimum (+5V, Ground, and TX/RX for communications).

The space within the Neutrona Wand is extremely limited, though multiple components must be fit into this space. To maximize what is available, some wires from the original controller (PCB) can be directly soldered onto the Arduino Nano. Where resistors or inline components are required, these may be soldered between the wire and Arduino Nano to reduce need for an additional protoboard. If needed, a [a ¼ protoboard from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1608) or any similar size from another manufacturer will be used.

## Special Cautions and Warnings

You will find that the wand poses some challenges due to confined spaces and fragile wires to all the stock components. The following are suggestions to help you minimize damage to existing wiring, unless you plan to remove all the stock components and connect new wires.

- Remove what you can of any plastic covers over the switches internally, and use a hot glue gun to carefully drip glue over the soldered ends of the toggles, rotary encoder, and any other wire connections to reinforce them as they stand.
- Gently separate any wires that are bonded together, allowing about 1" of excess for stripping.
- Use a mechanical wire stripper to ensure you quickly strip back the sheathing for each wire.
- Use silicone-coated **stranded** wiring (22AWG down to 26AWG) to allow for maximum flexibility.
- Solder on extensions to every wire in the wand and use heat-shrink tubing to reinforce extended connections to make a better bond with the stock wire to prevent breakage.
- Continue the extended wire to either a PCB or the Nano for soldering, making sure that ALL of the strands of wire make it through the holes. Twist your bare wires tightly, and you can pre-tin the ends with a bit of solder to keep everything together as you fit the wire through any PCB holes (this also works well for making breadboard connections).
- Optionally, this is where you may consider a full replacement of some wires if they break off at the component you are connecting.
- It's too easy to have some strands that get missed which could cause a short--check your connections after soldering. A magnifying glass and good lighting is your friend!

# (Important) Neutrona Wand Barrel LEDs wire colour differences.

It appears some of the silver tip generation 1 Neutrona Wands and orange tip generation 2 Neutrona Wands may have different wire colour combinations for the barrel LED lights:

## Generation 1 (Silver tip Neutrona Wands)

**Special Switches**

These switches utilize a "pull down" resistor to measure the difference in voltage when the button or switch is depressed. Each switch will get +5V power on one wire, while the other wire will connect to both a 10K resistor and an Arduino Nano pin. The other side of the resistor will connect to ground. This allows the pin to go to ground (low) when power is not supplied (read: the switch is not depressed), and the pin gets when +5V is present when the switch is depressed.

For the SLO-BLO and Front-Left LED which share on 1 pin from the Nano. The spec sheet for the Nano states a max 40mA draw on a pin. With 2 LEDs it is at that threshold. I have been testing this setup extensively and have not blown out the pin. I prefer this solution as it requires less space than using a transistor method.

## Component Fitment

As noted at the start of this guide the space inside of the gun box for the wand is extremely limited. Creative placement of any protoboards, the Arduino, WAV Trigger, and speaker (if upgraded) will be left to each individual. As a matter of advice, placing the WAV Trigger under the wand barrel is an advised option with other items "stacked" above and beside the spring-loaded mechanism.

### (See the alternate component fitment section below for more information on the stacking option) ###

For another fitment option, the WAV Trigger can also fit in the opposite half of the gun box if the barrel jack is removed--this is to avoid the spring which attaches to the wand barrel.

### (See the Audio Output addendum for more information on the opposite half gun box mounting solution)

Below is a view of the wand internals showing the Arduino Nano, a PCB for connections, and many of the wires which extend the stock wiring. This solution is using several of the included STL files: a small spacer is meant to fit under the barrel if you removed some of the plastic from the old controller mount; another 3D printed part is meant to protect the wiring from intruding on the barrel latching mechanism while still allowing the wires to connect to the barrel. And lastly, a mini USB cable has been routed through the casing to allow updating of the Arduino without removing the cover--in this case the vibration motor had already been removed to save space and make this area more accessible.

## Alternate component fitment
This solution requires removing plastic within the wand, and printing some of the included STL mount files and stacking the PCB board then Arduino Nano on top of the WAV Trigger. Everything is then screwed into one of the remaining holes in the wand body.
