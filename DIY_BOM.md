# Bill of Materials

This guide should provide a listing of minimal/required components as well as any optional items needed for the conversion.

Note that just about everything can be sourced at [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/) or [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/) among usual sites such as [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) or [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/). The HasLab equipment makes use of both [JST-XH and JST-PH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JST_connector) connectors, so buy accordingly for your headers and plugs if you wish to continue using the stock connectors.

## Tools & Connectors

These items are considered optional but useful. If you are using the ready-to-use PCBs you may only be interested in the pin crimping tool and JST connectors. Otherwise, if soldering is in your skillset you may consider the TS101 as a worthwhile upgrade for easier soldering.

| 1   | 35 LED Pixel Ring (96mm OD) | OPTIONAL - For the Inner Cyclotron. The Arduino software supports other sizes of rings. 35 pixel ring is the default and recommended to avoid altering the software. Although, configuring an alternative ring size is trivial for this particular item. | [Single Ring](https://a.co/d/fAmEV3r) or [Multi-Ring Kit](https://a.co/d/hJlh9vD) |
| 1   | 40 LED Pixel Ring (132mm OD) | OPTIONAL - For the Cyclotron Lid, which MUST be exactly 40 pixels to fit properly behind the lenses. If you wish to purchase 1 kit for multiple uses, this contains a 112mm ring with 32 LEDs which may be a suitable for use with the Inner Cyclotron (will require a small configuration change to the software). | [Multi-Ring Kit](https://a.co/d/40wMl8T) |

| 1   | Rotary Encoder | OPTIONAL - I use a standard Rotary Encoder with 24 positions. I use this instead of the HasLab one which is 5 positions I believe. I did not test out the HasLab one with my wiring, though I have no reason to believe it would not work the same. This is for the Volume control in the crank generator. | [https://www.adafruit.com/product/377](https://www.adafruit.com/product/377)<br/>[360 Degree Rotary Encoder](https://a.co/d/26nl9OB) |
